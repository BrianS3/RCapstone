# RCapstone

This project repo holds the files for the IBM R Data Science Specialization. The specialization includes a Capstone project, which is a series of lessons that teach you how to use R to solve real-world data science problems.
While work was done in R, jupyter notebooks were required for use, within the IBM cloud environment.
